# Todobot collects the following data:


I only store the bary minimum of data that I have to store for the bot to work. That means I'm storing **guild ids**, **message ids** and the contents of the todos/tasks submitted by users. 

- Guild ID's 
- Message ID's (only messages sent by the bot) 

## What data is not stored?

- **Message Contents** I only need to store the message ids of the messages that the bot posted with the users todo/task.
- **Any Guild Member related data** The permission system of the bot uses roles so I dont have to store user ids and guild members have full privacy. However, if they sumbit a todo, their user id will be saved with the todo object.

# How do we collect your data?
You directly provide Todobot with most of the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you:

- Create a new todo-list 
- Invite the bot to your guild (a new configuration will be generated and saved)
- Interact with todo-list messages 

# How do we store your data?
Todobot securely stores your data at 2 Locations. NÃ¼rnberg, Germany and a raspberry pi at a private home utilized for backups. Our hosting provider is [Contabo](https://contabo.com).

Todobot will keep your data for as long as the bot is on your guild. Once this time period has expired, we will delete your data by deleting all todo-lists and the configuration in the database and the configuration stored in cache.

## Is your data safe with us?

Yes.

## How can we be so sure?

We follow best practices when it comes to securing and monitoring our servers and/or applications properly. There are also multiple intrusion detection systems in place.

# Marketing
